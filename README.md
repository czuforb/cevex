# New website for Cevex Kft.

_For my final project at KEA I decided to redesign and give a new porpuse for the long abandoned - and unused - website of Cevex Kft._

The report of the project is [here](https://www.notion.so/cbence/Final-Exam-Report-f5e84cc12d8f481187f0883a63c0a3cd).I used GatsbyJS with WordPress as a headless CMS for this project and TailwindCSS.

## Install + run

```

npm install

gatsby develop

```

It is not finished yet => TODO.md
